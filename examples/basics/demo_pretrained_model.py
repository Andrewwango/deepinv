Use a pretrained model
====================================================================================================

Follow this example to reconstruct images using a pretrained model in one line.

We show three sets of general pretrained reconstruction methods, including:

* Pretrained feedforward :class:`Reconstruct Anything Model (RAM) <deepinv.models.RAM>`;
* :ref:`Plug-and-play <iterative>` with a pretrained denoiser.
* Pretrained :ref:`diffusion model <diffusion>`;

See :ref:`User Guide <pretrained-reconstructors>` for a principled comparison between methods demonstrated in this example.

.. tip::

    * Want to use your own dataset? See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_basics_demo_custom_dataset.py`
    * Want to use your own physics? See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_basics_demo_custom_physics.py`

# Let's say you want to reconstruct a butterfly from noisy, blurry measurements:

x = dinv.utils.load_example("butterfly.png")

# Define physics

    filter=dinv.physics.blur.gaussian_blur((5, 5)),

# For each model, define model in one line and reconstruct in one line.

model = dinv.sampling.DDRM(denoiser, sigmas=torch.linspace(1, 0, 10))
